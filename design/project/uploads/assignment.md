## System Description: Institute Management System (IMS)

The Institute Management System (IMS) is designed to automate the management processes of
an educational institute-from student admission to examination management, course scheduling
to human resources, and salary management.
Your overarching goal is to model theentire systemconceptually, but you will only pro-
totype and implementDashboard plus end-to-end features of two specific modulesof
your choice.

- Broadcast information regarding school events, news, and holidays.

### Time Table

- Drag-and-drop creation interface for easy scheduling.
- Real-time alerts on subject limits per week and employee workload limits.
- Ability to create, edit, or delete timetables in advance.

### Manage News


- Create, edit, and search news using a rich text format (RTF).
- Facility for users to comment on published news.
- Moderation tools to delete comments or news entries.

## Task 1: System Design & Report

You must prepare a comprehensive, self-written design report - as a pdf. Verbosity and
unnecessary verbiage will be strictly penalized. Keep your explanations concise and to
the point. The report must contain:

1. Hand-drawn UML Class Diagram:Model theentireIMS system. Include inheritance
    (generalization), association, composition relationships, operations, cardinality, and role
    indicators. You may split it into smaller parts and show relations between them. Messy
    and unreadable diagrams will be penalized.
2. Responsibilities Table: A table summarizing the responsibilities of each major class
    from your UML.
3. Dynamic Diagrams:
    - Sequence Diagramsfor any3flowswithin the system.
    - State Diagrammodeling any1 major entity/partof the system.
4. Design Narrative & Analysis: A brief narrative outlining how your design balances
    criteria like low coupling, high cohesion, separation of concerns, and the Law of Demeter.
5. Pattern & Anti-Pattern Analysis: Discuss at least 2 design patterns and 2 design
    anti-patterns present (or avoided) in your design.
6. Reflection: A short reflection on the two strongest and two weakest aspects of your
    design.

## Feature Selection & Implementation Constraints

While your UML diagrams in Task 1 must model the entire IMS system, your UI prototyping
(Task 2) and Android implementation (Task 3) will focus on a specific subset of features.

### 1. Mandatory Module: The Dashboard

Every teammustdesign and implement the Dashboard.Note:The extensive list of capabilities
provided for the Dashboard in the previous section was for your reference. For Tasks 2 and
3, you have full creative liberty - provided it is intuitive, visually polished, and serves as a
functional, end-to-end navigational hub for your app that and includes all essential features.

### 2. Elective Modules

In addition to the Dashboard, you must select exactlytwomore modules to implement end-
to-end. To ensure your prototype covers a diverse range of system interactions and data flows,
you must chooseexactly onemodule from each of the following two categories:

- Category A: Core Process Modules (Choose ONE):


- Finance
- Human Resources
- Examinations
- Time Table
- Category B: Data Management Modules (Choose ONE):
These modules focus primarily on data entry, retrieval, and user interactions.
- Student Admission
- Attendance
- Student DetailsorManage Users
- MessagesorManage News

## Task 2: UI/UX Prototyping (Figma)

For the selected modules that you plan to implement end-to-end, you need to:

1. Wireframes:Build low-fidelity wireframes for your dashboard and the features of the 2
    chosen modules using Figma. For those new to wireframes, refer to the linkhere.
2. Mock UI (High-Fidelity): Create high-fidelity mobile-based UI prototypes for these
    features in Figma. The design must be visually polished and well desgined.
3. Design Inspiration:Explicitly mention3 mobile apps/websitesyou took inspiration
    from. It must be evident in your report and design what UI/UX aspects were taken from
    which sources.
4. Your UI must follow atleast 3 usability principles from the slides which must be evident
    throughout the app.

## Task 3: Android Implementation

You are required to build a functional Android app prototype for thedashboard and chosen
modulesdesigned in Task 2.Make sure in yourbuild.gradleyou have aBuildConfigField
of String type with the exactnameAPPIDENTIFIERto be set to the value
yourrollnumber.teammatesrollnumber(oryourrollnumber.0if doing the assignment
individually)

1. Tech Stack Restriction: The UI must be built natively usingJetpack Compose.
    Frameworks like Flutter, React Native, etc., are strictly prohibited (Students without
    Android devices must use the Android Studio Emulator).
2. End-to-End Functionality: The selected modules must work seamlessly from end to
    end within the prototype. The UI should match your high-fidelity Figma designs closely.
    It is also important that your prototypemustfollow the same workflow i.e support the
    exact same set of features as in our actual IMS system.
3. Codebase Documentation: Provide documentation for your codebase. This must be
    short, concise, and to the point. Unnecessary verbosity in documentation will attract
    penalties.


Note: As you do not have access to a server for data, you may store the database in the
app itself and simulate the end-to-end functionality by having stubs and easy role switching.

## Strict Rules & Guidelines

- No Verbosity: Reports and documentation must be dense with value. Flu”, filler text,
    and verbiage will lead to negative marking.

## Grading Rubric (Approximate)

Please note that while deliverables are graded,the Viva will carry the majority weightto
verify your understanding, design decisions, and code authenticity.

```

UI flow explanation, and system knowledge.
```
#### 50%

Note: Deductions will be strictly applied for unauthorized tech stacks, messy diagrams, AI
usage, and verbose documentation - in which case straight 0 in the implementation section too.

## Submission Instructions

Everythingmust be pushed onto Github classroom repository with all links included. The
